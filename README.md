# AgarRepacker

This project was created when I was a kid and later published on my old GitHub account, so please forgive the shitty code. ğŸ˜… AgarRepacker was intended to act as a proxy between Agar.io servers and legacy Agar.io clients, allowing you to use old clients that didnâ€™t support newer server protocols. It was my attempt to bridge the gap between the old and new versions of Agar.io.

Miniclip (the creators of Agar.io) encrypted the entire client-server communication using a special algorithm to generate a new 32-bit key for each packet sent to the server. They obfuscated the core code using LLVM and Emscripten to run it in the browser. To make AgarRepacker work, I had to reverse-engineer the encryption algorithm and the communication protocol.

# Main Encryption/Decryption Breakdown
Miniclip used a special algorithm to generate a unique key for each packet. This key is then used for XOR encryption on each byte of the packet before sending it to the server. Here's the main key-generation algorithm:

```javascript
        key = Math.imul(key, 1540483477) | 0
        key = (Math.imul(key >>> 24 ^ key, 1540483477) | 0) ^ 114296087
        key = Math.imul(key >>> 13 ^ key, 1540483477) | 0
        key = key >>> 15 ^ key
        return key
```

After the key is generated, a XOR operation is applied to each byte of the packet using the key. The key is rotated after each packet is sent.

AgarRepacker was created to decode and re-encrypt the packets on the fly so old clients could still communicate with newer servers.
